                    Hi, everyone!
                    It's great to be here!

                <p>
                    This talk is about contributing to open-source,
                    why it's important to contribute, how would that help us and
                    how to start contributing.
                    Let's just get started with a bit of history.

                <h2>Open-source in 1998</h2>
                <aside class="notes">
                    It was a different time back in the late 90's
                    when the open-source term was coined and made popular.

                    Before the term open-source there was the so-called
                    free software.

                    It's important to understand why the effort was made
                    to make the open-source term and open-source software popular.

                <aside class="notes">
                    This was the time of the Halloween documents &mdash;
                    leaked internal reports from Microsoft showing how a big software
                    company having dominance on the market was aiming to diminish
                    open-source software and to impede its growth.

                <aside class="notes">
                    Then the Open Source Initiative was started by Bruce Perens and Eric Raymond.
                    They tried to help open-source software with its marketing problem.
                    Free software was mistaken as just being without cost instead of
                    providing freedom.
                    Open-source and the initiatives around it helped create the image
                    of open development, distribution and modification of the software
                    in the minds of the public.

                    <p>
                        Open source is now ubiquitous. Everyone is using it.
                        From big corporations to high-school students in developing nations.
                        Even non-open-source software is using hundreds of open-source libraries.
                        We know open-source is not going anywhere.

                        Governments are also embracing open-source.
                        The US government has recently released the People's Code
                        and the Bulgarian parliament has passed a law stating
                        every new government project should be open-source.

                        GitHub has released its state of the Octoverse a couple of months ago.
                        They said the organisation with the largest number of open-source contributors
                        is Microsoft. If you say that to people from the past, they will laugh at you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I would say the problems open-source was facing before
                        are now mostly solved. Small teams, big corporations and governments
                        all embracing it and this just increases even more with time.
                        The adoption of open-source is not a problem.

                <aside class="notes">
                    <p>
                        But with more and more new people diving into programming,
                        we have more and more users and relatively fewer and fewer contributors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many of the people from the generation which grew
                        open-source to what it is today were contributing heavily.
                        We need new people to do the same.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also, there are experienced people who have something to contribute,
                        but for one reason or another they hold back.

                    <p>
                        Open-source is taken for granted.
                        Every new developer who starts programming is using it
                        &mdash; from the .NET stack to the latest JavaScript
                        package manager.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But the question is whether the majority of them would
                        join the open-source community
                    </p>
                </aside>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Maintainers&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;Contributors&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;Users</h3>
                <aside class="notes">
                    <p>
                        This is a formula which I believe holds true.
                        The number of contributors of a repository is greater than
                        or equal to the number of maintainers.
                        The number of users however is significantly greater than
                        the number of contributors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And this will hold true even if more people join open-source.
                        But we need to make sure the gap between number of contributors
                        and number of users does not increase materially.

                        Even people who are not programmers or not technical at all could help.

                        Giving back to the community?
                        Some people are indeed motivated by that, but I think
                        this comes later when you explore the beauty of
                        the open-source community more.
                        And a lot would not consider this a driving motive.

                        Many people think contributing to open-source means
                        doing work without payment for the greater good.
                        And this is true in many cases, but that's not the only thing.
                        You are getting a lot in return as well.

                        I want to make the case for the idea that open-source
                        contributions could help <strong>you</strong>.
                        It's often seen as a selfless act, but it also brings
                        you a lot of benefits and self-improvements.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Contributing to open-source is not a zero-sum game.
                        When you use open-source it doesn't loose anything
                        and when you contribute back you gain as well.

                        My name is Haralan Dobrev. You can call me Harry.
                        I am <em>hkdobrev</em> everywhere on the web.
                        I am currently CTO at this small and cool startup Clippings.com.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am not very experienced and I don't have any big popular
                        open-source repositories of my own.
                        However, when I see something I don't like, I fix it.
                        I scratch my own itch.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I maintain a few packages we've open-sourced at Clippings
                        and I'm added as a collaborator to a couple of other repositories.

                    <p>
                        So I am mostly a contributor, not a maintainer.
                        But I've learned a lot over the last few years from
                        participating in open-source.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I learned a lot about best practices.
                        I improved my communication skills significantly.
                        When I was starting to use a new interesting library at work,
                        I then later explored it, found out what I was missing and
                        started contributing.
                        And vice-versa, when I was contributing to an interesting project
                        and if later I introduce it in my day-to-day work I already
                        knew a lot about it and what it would or wouldn't do.

                        You can learn from people better than you

                        You will improve your communication.
                        You'd learn to express yourself better,
                        defend your opinions with arguments and accept others'.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I can't stress this enough! Most people who don't have
                        long experience in open-source or remote work
                        cannot express themselves well in writing and especially
                        when communicating with people they don't know.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my opinion this is a key skill and it needs to be
                        sharpened whenever possible.

                        Many employers look for open-source contributions
                        when considering whether to hire you.
                        This may not be always fair, but
                        it is common.
                        However, the skills you will acquire and the things you
                        will learn during your open-source contributions would
                        actually make you a better candidate as well, not only
                        the number of pull requests, stars or followers.

                        The important is to start now.
                        Communicate with the maintainers the bug, the feature,

                        The impostor syndrome is quite common.
                        It describes the state of mind when you have an unrealistic
                        low self-esteem and feel fear of being exposed.
                        Many people feel it at work and it is also common in open-source.
                        People stop themselves from contributing, because they think
                        they are not worthy and don't have anything meaningful to
                        contribute.

                    <p>
                        In the IT industry this is especially common as there are
                        always people smarter than you and they are quite visible.
                        However, you need to believe in yourself.

                        But is this really true?
                        Ask your boss, manager, human resources or a company lawyer.
                        Chances are you are free to contribute to open-source projects.
                        Even if you don't you can ask for a permission.
                        Don't find excuses, just act.
                        Also, don't forget to think about whether your employer

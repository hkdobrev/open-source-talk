                    Hi, everyone!
                    It's great to be here!
                </p>
                <p>
                    This talk is about contributing to open-source,
                    why it's important to contribute, how would that help us and
                    how to start contributing.
                    Let's just get started with a bit of history.

                <h2>Open-source in 1998</h2>
                <aside class="notes">
                    It was a different time back in the late 90's
                    when the open-source term was coined and made popular.

                    Before the term open-source there was the so-called
                    free software.

                    It's important to understand why the effort was made
                    to make the open-source term and open-source software popular.

                <aside class="notes">
                    This was the time of the Halloween documents &mdash;
                    leaked internal reports from Microsoft showing how a big software
                    company having dominance on the market was aiming to diminish
                    open-source software and to impede its growth.

                <aside class="notes">
                    The Open Source Initiative was started by Bruce Perens and Eric Raymond.
                    They tried to help open-source software with its marketing problem.
                    Free software was mistaken as just being without cost instead of
                    providing freedom.
                    Open-source and the initiatives around it helped create the image
                    of open development, distribution and modification of the software
                    in the minds of the public.

                    <p>
                        Open source is now ubiquitous. Everyone is using it.
                        From big corporations to high-school students in developing nations.
                        Even non-open-source software is using hundreds of open-source libraries.
                        We know open-source is not going anywhere.

                    <p>
                        GitHub has released its state of the Octoverse a couple of months ago.
                        They said the organisation with the largest number of open-source contributors
                        is Microsoft. If you say that to people from the past they will laugh at you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I would say the problems open-source was facing before
                        are now mostly solved. Small teams, big corporations and governments
                        all are fine with using open-source and embrace it even more with time.
                        The adoption of open-source is not a problem.
                        Every new developer that starts programming is using it
                        &mdash; from the .NET stack to the latest JavaScript
                        package manager.

                <aside class="notes">
                    <p>
                        But with more and more new people diving into programming,
                        we have more and more users and relatively fewer and fewer contributors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many of the people from the generation which grew
                        open-source to what it is today were contributing heavily.
                        We need new people to do the same.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also there are experienced people who have something to contribute,
                        but for one reason or another they hold back.

                        And this is true in many cases, but that's not the only thing.
